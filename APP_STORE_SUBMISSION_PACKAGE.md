## Description

BlueJay helps you improve your diet with one simple weekly focus.

No calorie counting. No complex meal plans. Just one clear trade:
replace one high-risk food with a go-to healthier combo you can repeat.

How BlueJay works:

1) Recall: Log what you ate.
2) Focus: Get your top opportunities and pick one weekly focus.
3) Swap: Unlock practical combo swaps designed for that focus.
4) Track: Log your swap wins throughout the week.

Why users like BlueJay:

- One focus at a time (less overwhelm)
- Actionable swap combos (not vague advice)
- Fast daily workflow
- Built-in progress tracking

Subscriptions:

BlueJay offers auto-renewing monthly and annual subscriptions to unlock the full swaps library. Pricing may vary by region. Payment is charged to your Apple ID at confirmation of purchase. Subscription renews automatically unless canceled at least 24 hours before period end.
