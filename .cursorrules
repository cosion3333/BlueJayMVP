# BlueJay App - Cursor AI Rules

## 🔴 CRITICAL: Always Read Before Making Changes

When working on **app flow, navigation, UX, or SwiftUI screens**, you MUST first read:

**`BLUEJAY_SPEC.md`** (especially the "Core Product Context" section, lines 3-60)

## The Non-Negotiable Core Loop

```
Recall → Focus → Go-To Swap → Track Usage → Win
```

Every feature must support this cycle. Do not suggest changes that break it.

## Key Constraints

1. **ONE Weekly Focus at a Time** - Never suggest multi-select or parallel focuses
2. **No Dead-Ends** - Every screen must lead somewhere actionable
3. **The Trade Model** - Always frame swaps as trading bad food FOR good combo (not restriction)
4. **Paywall Placement** - Tab 3 (Swaps) is paywalled. Tab 1 & 2 are free
5. **Persistence** - Weekly Focus stays visible and active all week

## Tab Structure (3 Tabs)

- **Tab 1: Recall** - Food logging (Always Free)
- **Tab 2: Insights** - Weekly Focus selection + opportunities (Free with upsell potential)
- **Tab 3: Swaps** - Blue Jay Combos (PAYWALLED - this is the value)

## When Suggesting Changes

- ✅ Align with the core loop
- ✅ Maintain simplicity (one focus at a time)
- ✅ Respect the paywall strategy
- ✅ Keep navigation flow clear
- ❌ Don't add complexity that breaks "one focus" principle
- ❌ Don't suggest removing the weekly persistence
- ❌ Don't move the paywall or make premium content free
